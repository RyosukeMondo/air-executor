## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Atomic File Operations
```python
# All writes use temp file + rename pattern
def write_json(path, data):
    temp = path.with_suffix('.tmp')
    with open(temp, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f)
        os.fsync(f.fileno())
    temp.rename(path)  # Atomic!
```

### State Machine Validation
```python
class Job:
    def transition_to(self, new_state):
        valid_transitions = {
            JobState.WAITING: {JobState.WORKING, JobState.FAILED},
            JobState.WORKING: {JobState.COMPLETED, JobState.FAILED},
            # ...
        }
        if new_state not in valid_transitions[self.state]:
            raise ValueError("Invalid transition")
```

### Parallel Runner Spawning
```python
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_concurrent) as executor:
    futures = {executor.submit(spawn_one, job): job
               for job in jobs_to_spawn}
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        result = future.result()  # Handle errors per-job
```

### Graceful Shutdown
```python
def _handle_sigterm(self, signum, frame):
    self._shutdown_requested = True  # Complete current cycle

while not self._shutdown_requested:
    self.poll_once()
    time.sleep(self.poll_interval)
```

## 🚧 Future Enhancements (Not in MVP)

### Planned Features
- [ ] Web dashboard for monitoring
- [ ] Apache Airflow integration
- [ ] Prefect integration
- [ ] Retry policies
- [ ] Task priority scheduling
- [ ] Distributed job management
- [ ] WebSocket real-time updates
- [ ] Task execution metrics

### Why Not Included
These features require additional infrastructure (Kubernetes, message brokers, databases) or are beyond MVP scope. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for future extension.

## 🐛 Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Single-Machine**: File-based state doesn't support distributed deployment
   - **Impact**: Limited to single-region, single-instance
   - **Future**: Database-backed state for multi-instance

2. **No Retry Logic**: Failed tasks require manual re-queueing
   - **Impact**: Reduced resilience for transient failures
   - **Future**: Configurable retry policies

3. **CLI-Only Monitoring**: No web dashboard in MVP
   - **Impact**: Difficult to monitor remotely
   - **Future**: Web UI with real-time updates

4. **No Resource Limits**: Tasks can consume unbounded resources
   - **Impact**: Risk of resource exhaustion
   - **Future**: cgroup limits, resource quotas
