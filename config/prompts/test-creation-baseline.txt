This flutter project has NO TESTS. Create initial test suite.

**Critical Requirements:**

1. Find/install appropriate test framework (should already be in pubspec.yaml as flutter_test)
2. Create meaningful tests based on code analysis
3. Set up test infrastructure if needed

**Steps:**
1. Verify flutter_test is in pubspec.yaml dependencies
2. Create test/ directory if it doesn't exist
3. Analyze main application code to understand what to test
4. Create at least 3-5 test files covering:
   - Widget tests for UI components
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests if applicable

**Output:**
- Tests should be runnable with: flutter test
- Commit changes with message describing tests created
- Tests should actually pass when run

**Important:**
- Don't create mock/stub tests - create real, meaningful tests
- Follow Flutter testing best practices
- Ensure tests are discoverable by flutter test command
