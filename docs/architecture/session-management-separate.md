# Self-Contained Fix Plan (Separate Sessions)

This plan is for fixing project issues when context resets between sessions (browser refresh, new chat, etc).

## üîß Self-Contained Fix Prompt (Copy-Paste for Each Session)

```
You are tasked with fixing ONE critical issue in this Flutter project per session.
Context resets between runs, so you must be fully autonomous.

## Your Workflow (Every Single Run)

### Step 1: Quick Analysis (2 minutes)
Scan the project to find ALL categories of issues:

1. **Compilation Blockers** (CRITICAL - breaks build)
   - Missing files that are imported
   - Undefined functions/classes that are called
   - Syntax errors
   Command: Check imports in main.dart and key files

2. **Runtime Blockers** (CRITICAL - app crashes)
   - DI resolution failures
   - Missing provider implementations
   - Null reference errors
   Command: Read main.dart, check DI setup

3. **Incomplete Features** (HIGH - promised but missing)
   - Steering document features not implemented
   - Specs marked complete but code missing
   Command: Compare .spec-workflow/PARALLEL_SPECS_PLAN.md with actual code

4. **Task Status Lies** (MEDIUM - tracking issues)
   - tasks.md says complete but code doesn't exist
   - tasks.md says incomplete but code exists
   Command: Sample check 3-5 specs

5. **Test Failures** (LOW - quality issues)
   - Unit tests failing
   - Integration tests broken
   Command: Check test/ directory

6. **Technical Debt** (LOW - polish)
   - Missing docs
   - Code smells
   - Performance issues

### Step 2: Priority Selection
Pick the SINGLE HIGHEST PRIORITY issue using this order:
1. Compilation Blockers ‚Üí fix immediately
2. Runtime Blockers ‚Üí fix immediately
3. Incomplete Features ‚Üí pick one critical feature
4. Task Status Lies ‚Üí batch update multiple tasks.md files
5. Test Failures ‚Üí fix one test suite
6. Technical Debt ‚Üí skip for now

### Step 3: Implement Fix
1. Fix the chosen issue completely
2. Verify it works (compile/run/test as needed)
3. Update related tasks.md if applicable
4. Commit with descriptive message
5. Push to remote

### Step 4: Report
Output this format:
```
## üéØ Session Complete

### Issues Found (Priority Order):
1. [CRITICAL] Missing environments.dart breaks compilation
2. [CRITICAL] initializeAsyncDependencies() undefined
3. [HIGH] Admob rewarded ads incomplete (7 tasks)
4. [MEDIUM] 3 specs have incorrect task status
5. [LOW] 12 tests failing

### Fixed This Session:
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Issue**: Missing environments.dart breaks compilation
**Solution**: Created lib/core/injection/environments.dart with environment constants

### Commit:
```
fix: add missing environments.dart for DI configuration

- Create environments.dart with prodEnv/devEnv/testEnv constants
- Fixes import error in main.dart
- Required for environment-based dependency injection

### Pushed: ‚úÖ commit abc1234 to origin/main

### Next Session Should Fix:
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Issue**: initializeAsyncDependencies() undefined
**Location**: Called in main.dart but not defined anywhere
**Estimated time**: 10 minutes
```

## Critical Rules
1. **Analyze FIRST** - Always scan for all issue categories before choosing
2. **Pick ONE** - Fix only the single highest priority issue
3. **Complete it** - Don't leave half-fixes
4. **Always commit & push** - Every session must produce one commit
5. **Tell me what's next** - So I know what to expect next run

## Optimization
- If you find multiple CRITICAL issues, fix the fastest one first
- If fixing one issue, and you notice a 30-second fix for another CRITICAL issue, do both in one commit
- Batch similar fixes (e.g., updating 5 tasks.md files is one commit)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
‚ùå Don't try to fix everything at once
‚ùå Don't skip analysis phase
‚ùå Don't commit without pushing
‚ùå Don't fix LOW priority before CRITICAL
‚ùå Don't leave compilation errors

## START NOW
Execute Step 1 (Analysis), Step 2 (Pick Priority), Step 3 (Fix), Step 4 (Report)
```

## How to Use

1. **Copy the entire prompt** (from "You are tasked..." to "Execute Step 1...")
2. **Paste into NEW Claude Code session**
3. **Wait 3-5 minutes** - Claude analyzes, picks highest priority, fixes, commits, pushes
4. **Read the "Next Session Should Fix"** section
5. **Start NEW session** (context reset)
6. **Paste the SAME prompt again**
7. **Repeat** until "No critical issues found"

## Expected Results Per Session

- **Time per session**: 3-10 minutes
- **Output**: 1 commit, pushed to remote
- **Progress**: One issue completely resolved
- **Clarity**: You'll know exactly what's next

## Example Session Flow

**Session 1**: Finds 5 issues ‚Üí Fixes missing environments.dart ‚Üí Commits ‚Üí Pushes ‚Üí Says "Next: fix initializeAsyncDependencies"

**Session 2** (new context): Finds 4 issues ‚Üí Fixes initializeAsyncDependencies ‚Üí Commits ‚Üí Pushes ‚Üí Says "Next: complete admob-rewarded-ads"

**Session 3** (new context): Finds 3 issues ‚Üí Completes admob-rewarded-ads ‚Üí Commits ‚Üí Pushes ‚Üí Says "Next: fix task status for 3 specs"

Continue until: "‚úÖ No critical or high priority issues found. Project is healthy!"

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ Works with context resets (browser refresh, new sessions)
- ‚úÖ Each session is independent and complete
- ‚úÖ Always makes progress regardless of context loss
- ‚úÖ Clear priority system prevents wasted effort
- ‚úÖ Git history shows incremental improvements

## When to Use

Use this approach when:
- Browser/editor might refresh between runs
- Working across multiple days/sessions
- Want maximum fault tolerance
- Prefer autonomous execution without supervision
- Need to step away and come back later

## Progress Tracking

Since context resets, track progress via:
- Git commit history (`git log --oneline -10`)
- "Next Session Should Fix" message from previous run
- Project health improves with each session

## Completion Indicator

You'll know you're done when a session reports:
```
## üéØ Session Complete

### Issues Found (Priority Order):
(none at CRITICAL or HIGH priority)

### Fixed This Session:
Nothing - project is healthy!

### Next Session Should Fix:
No critical issues remaining. Consider:
- Running full test suite
- Performance optimization
- Documentation improvements
```
