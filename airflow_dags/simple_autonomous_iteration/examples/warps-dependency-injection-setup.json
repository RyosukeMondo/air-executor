  "prompt": "Resume work on dependency-injection-setup specification. Work incrementally with commits:\n\n**THIS ITERATION - Complete ONE task only:**\n1. Use MCP tool spec-workflow to check status: Call spec-status with projectPath='/home/rmondo/repos/warps' and specName='dependency-injection-setup'\n2. Read the tasks.md file to find the NEXT uncompleted task (look for [ ] markers)\n3. If you need guidance, use MCP tool spec-workflow-guide to understand the workflow\n4. Implement ONLY that one task following the _Prompt field guidance\n5. Test the implementation (run tests, verify functionality)\n6. Update tasks.md: change [ ] to [-] when starting, then to [x] when complete\n7. Commit changes with descriptive message (include task number and description)\n8. DONE - End this iteration (next iteration will continue with next task)\n\n**Critical:**\n- Complete ONLY ONE task per iteration (not multiple tasks)\n- Use spec-workflow MCP tools for status checking and guidance\n- Follow the _Prompt field in each task (Role | Task | Restrictions | Success)\n- After commit, this iteration is DONE\n- Orchestrator will automatically start next iteration\n- Each iteration = one task cycle\n- This is Phase 1A: TSyringe DI foundation\n- Working on main branch at project root\n- ONLY mark final completion checklist when ALL tasks are truly complete\n\nCurrent completion detection: Check tasks.md for final task marked [x]\n\n**Reference Docs:**\n- Plan: /home/rmondo/repos/warps/claudedocs/PARALLEL-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md\n- Spec: /home/rmondo/repos/warps/.spec-workflow/specs/dependency-injection-setup/",
