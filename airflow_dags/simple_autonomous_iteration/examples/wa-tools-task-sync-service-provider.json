  "prompt": "Resume work on task-sync-service-provider specification. Work incrementally with commits:\n\n**THIS ITERATION - Complete ONE task only:**\n1. Use MCP tool spec-workflow to check status: Call spec-status with projectPath='/home/rmondo/repos/wa-tools' and specName='task-sync-service-provider'\n2. Read the tasks.md file to find the NEXT uncompleted task (look for [ ] markers)\n3. If you need guidance, use MCP tool spec-workflow-guide to understand the workflow\n4. Implement ONLY that one task (or couple tightly related tasks in same section)\n5. Make/update tests for what you changed (verify tests pass)\n6. Run linter and fix any issues: `./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse app/Providers/TaskSyncServiceProvider.php app/TaskSync/Application/Listeners/ --level=8`\n7. Update tasks.md: mark the completed task with [x]\n8. Commit changes with descriptive message (include task number and description)\n9. DONE - End this iteration (next iteration will continue with next task)\n\n**Critical:**\n- Complete ONLY ONE task per iteration (not multiple tasks)\n- Use spec-workflow MCP tools for status checking and guidance\n- After commit, this iteration is DONE\n- Orchestrator will automatically start next iteration\n- Each iteration = one task cycle\n- ONLY mark final completion checklist when ALL tasks are truly complete\n\nCurrent completion detection: Check tasks.md for Phase 5 completion",
